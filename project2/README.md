# Project 2 

## Description

This script will provide information about the hard drive of your choice connected to the host.

## Getting Started
Before you start, make sure you run the script in an IDE that supports PowerShell scripts (.ps1). No additional software is required.

## Installation

An IDE that supports .ps1 files will need to be downloaded. Once the script is downloaded, run it with the IDE of your choice. I prefer PowerShell ISE.

## Usage

Run the script and you will be prompted to enter the hard drive you want the script to get information from. Make sure you include a letter that represents the hard drive, followed by a colon.

Afterwards, the script will list information about the selected hard drive. Run the script again if you want to look at another hard drive.  

Enjoy!!
